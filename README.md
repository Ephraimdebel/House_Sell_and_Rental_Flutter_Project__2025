## Project Overview  
The **House Sell and Rental Management System** is a mobile application built with **Jetpack Compose** that allows users to **buy, sell, and rent houses** easily. The system provides a secure and efficient way for property owners to list their houses, while buyers and renters can browse available properties, contact owners, and finalize transactions.  

The project includes:  
- Two main business features: **house selling and renting** (each with full CRUD operations).  
- **Authentication and authorization** for secure access.  
- A **REST API backend** to serve the frontend.  
- Thorough testing, including **widget, unit, and integration testing**.
